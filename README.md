# PHP Magazine
PHP Magazine! is a website for sharing blog posts, it is an open source solution that is available for free to everyone. With PHP Magazine you can create your own site to upload news or information that you think is relevant, PHP Magazine gives you the ability to have a presence on the internet, whether you are a newspaper or blogger. This platform was released in December 2022 after hard coding work and I guarantee that it will continue to be maintained.

## Important Information

> PHP Magazine can be installed on any server, it is made to consume few resources. However, this will vary depending on the traffic flow you handle.

This beta version does not have a user-friendly installer, so you will have to upload the files to your server and configure the different features manually. But I assure you it won't be that complex ðŸ˜….

### Server Requirements
- Node.js 19.x+ (Optional)
- PHP 7.4.x+
- MySQL 8.0.x+
- Apache 2.4.x+ (with mod_rewrite enabled)

### Make sure you have the following dependencies installed
- Curl
- GD Library
- Mbstring
- Mail
- OpenSSL

Once Prerequisites Are Installed
---------------

Now that the prerequisites are ready to go it's a few simple commands to get your instance up and running.

```bash
# Get the latest version of PHP Magazine
git clone https://github.com/soyvillareal/PHP-Magazine.git

# Install PHP libraries
composer install

# If you won't be using NodeJS, you can skip this step, but if you want to use it in the future, you'll need to go back and do it.
# Install Node modules
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm start
```

## For install:
Once your files, dependencies, and requirements are ready, make sure to:

- Locate the `PHP-Magazine.sql` file and import it to your server.

- locate the info.php file, it is located in the path `/assets/includes/info.php`. Once here, do what the comments in the code indicate:

## Change platform information

At the moment, to make these types of changes you need to visit the database and locate yourself in the `settings` table, here you will find the following:

**Note:** I know that it can be cumbersome to have to modify manually, I assure you that the following table is only here until I develop the administration panel, for now enjoy the beta version.

## Personalization

### Images
In the path `themes/default/images` you will find the following list of images:

- favicon.ico (Website icon)
- logo-light.png (Light mode logo)
- logo-night.png (Dark mode logo)
- opengraph.jpeg (Image displayed on social media for all pages except user and post)
- preloader.gif (Don't touch it unless you know what you're doing)

You can replace the above images with the ones that best represent your website.

### Color palette
If you need to modify the color palette of the website, you can do it without much problem. Just make sure you have `show_palette` (see [table above](#change-platform-information) if you don't know what this means) set to `on` and log in with an administrator account to do this.
